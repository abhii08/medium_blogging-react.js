- TypeScript as the language  
- Prisma as the ORM, with connection pooling  
- Postgres as the database  
- JWT for authentication
  
## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

### 1. `backend`

    - PostgreSQL (database, referenced in Prisma schema)
  - **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  - **Validation**: Zod (via shared @abhinav08/medium-blogging package)
  - **Deployment**: Wrangler (Cloudflare Workers CLI)

### 2. `common`
   - **Validation**: Zod (for input validation)
   - **Type Sharing**: TypeScript types shared between frontend and backend

### 3. `frontend`
   - **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
   - **Build Tool**: Vite
   - **Styling**:
     - Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
     - PostCSS (for processing Tailwind)
